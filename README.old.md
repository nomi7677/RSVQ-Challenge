# Ron Swanson Quote Voter

## The Goal

Create a simple React application that will retrieve a list of Ron Swanson quotes from the Ron Swanson Quotes API where users can then upvote or downvote their favorite quotes. 

## Requirements

The Application should connect to the Ron Swanson Quotes API
(https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes)


The Application should consist of three components:
- A Header
- An individual quote component
- A List containing the quote components

Each Quote should have the quote text, an upvote and downvote button, and a score based on the number of upvotes and downvotes

The Header will contain a title as well as a tally of all of the votes

Each component should be styled

Each component should have unit tests

## Notes

No need to store the votes in any kind of back-end, storing them in session is fine for this challenge

You may use any libraries you think you'll need to complete the task

## Bonus

Add a dark mode toggle switch

A selector so that the user can choose how many quotes per screen

A search bar for finding specific quotes in the API
